**Trade Account Ranking Analysis Report**

## **1. Methodology**

### **1.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing**
The dataset comprises historical trade records from various Binance accounts over a 90-day period. Each trade entry includes details such as:
- **Port_IDs:** Unique identifiers for accounts.
- **Trade_History:** A list of trade records containing:
  - **Timestamp** (trade execution time)
  - **Asset** (traded cryptocurrency)
  - **Side** (BUY/SELL)
  - **Position Side** (LONG/SHORT)
  - **Price** (execution price)
  - **Quantity** (money involved in trade)
  - **Qty** (coin amount)
  - **Realized Profit** (PnL per trade)

The dataset was loaded and preprocessed by:
- Parsing trade history stored as strings into structured lists.
- Handling missing values by filtering out incomplete trade records.
- Extracting relevant financial metrics for analysis.

### **1.2 Trade Position Identification**
Each trade was classified based on its **side** (BUY/SELL) and **positionSide** (LONG/SHORT):
- **Long Open**: BUY trade in a long position.
- **Long Close**: SELL trade in a long position.
- **Short Open**: SELL trade in a short position.
- **Short Close**: BUY trade in a short position.

### **1.3 Financial Metrics Computation**
To evaluate account performance, the following key financial metrics were computed:

1. **Return on Investment (ROI)**
   - ROI is calculated as the total realized profit divided by the initial balance, multiplied by 100.
   
2. **Profit and Loss (PnL)**
   - This is the sum of all realized profits and losses from executed trades.

3. **Sharpe Ratio**
   - Sharpe Ratio is computed as the average return divided by the standard deviation of returns.
   
4. **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**
   - Maximum Drawdown is the highest observed loss from a peak in the equity curve.

5. **Win Rate**
   - Win Rate is the number of profitable trades divided by the total number of trades, multiplied by 100.

6. **Total Positions & Win Positions**
   - Total number of executed trades.
   - Number of trades with positive realized profit.

### **1.4 Ranking Algorithm**
A **weighted scoring system** was used to rank accounts based on:
- The final score is computed as ROI plus Sharpe Ratio, minus Max Drawdown, plus Win Rate.
- Accounts were then **sorted in descending order** based on their final score, and the **top 20 accounts** were selected as the best-performing accounts.

## **2. Findings**
After applying the ranking methodology to the dataset, the following insights were derived:

1. **Top-performing accounts** exhibited:
   - **High ROI** with positive cumulative PnL.
   - **Stable risk management** with low Max Drawdown.
   - **High Win Rates**, ensuring a consistent trading strategy.

2. **Risky accounts** with high drawdowns but strong ROI showed **volatile trading patterns**, leading to inconsistency.

3. **Consistent traders** with high Sharpe Ratios demonstrated a better balance between risk and reward.

4. **Total trading volume did not always correlate with profitability**, meaning that frequent trading does not guarantee better returns.

The **final ranking list of the top 20 accounts** was saved as a CSV file in Google Drive for further analysis.

## **3. Assumptions**
The analysis and ranking process were based on the following assumptions:

1. **Initial balance is approximated using the first trade's quantity.**
2. **No leverage effects were considered**; all trades are assumed to be executed with available funds only.
3. **Realized Profit represents true profitability**, assuming no hidden fees.
4. **Trades are executed at listed prices without slippage.**
5. **No external market conditions (such as news events) were factored into performance.**
6. **Equal weight was assigned to the financial metrics in the scoring formula** (though weightings can be adjusted).
7. **Only executed trades were analyzed; pending or canceled orders were excluded.**

## **4. Conclusion**
This analysis provided a structured ranking of Binance trade accounts based on profitability, consistency, and risk management. The scoring system effectively differentiates high-performing traders from risky or inconsistent ones.

Future enhancements could include:
- **Incorporating machine learning models** to predict future trade success.
- **Optimizing metric weightings** based on empirical testing.
- **Considering additional market factors** like volatility and liquidity.

This ranking system provides a **data-driven approach** to evaluating trade accounts and identifying the most successful trading strategies. ðŸš€
